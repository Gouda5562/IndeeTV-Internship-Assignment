Indee Tv Frontend Second Assignment 

#Overview

This project displays a list of the "Most-Watched Films" in a horizontal scrollable carousel format. The user can navigate through the movies using "previous" and "next" buttons. Each movie card includes an image, a title, and a "NEW" label indicating new movies.

#Approach

* "HTML Structure": The HTML is structured with a div container holding movie cards, each containing an image and a title. The pre-btn and nxt-btn buttons allow horizontal scrolling of the movie list.

* "CSS Styling": The CSS ensures the layout is clean and responsive. The card-container is set to display flex items in a row, allowing horizontal scrolling. Each card is styled to have a consistent size, with images fitting perfectly within the card boundaries. The "NEW" label is styled to stand out.

* "JavaScript Functionality": JavaScript is used to handle the scrolling functionality. Clicking the "previous" and "next" buttons scrolls the card-container by the width of two movie cards, providing a smooth navigation experience.
